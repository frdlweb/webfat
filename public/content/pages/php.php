# PHP in Hands down pages

Current time: **<?php echo date('h:m', time())  ?>**.

To enable PHP on a page, simply insert it... The file can still have the md extension. You can also give it php extension if you prefer, there is no difference (except the syntax highlightning of your editor)

(But paragraphs are lost)
